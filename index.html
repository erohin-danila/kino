                  The Batman is an upcoming American superhero film based on the
                  DC Comics character of the same name. Produced by DC Films and
                  distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it was developed as the
                  tenth film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and a reboot of
                  the Batman film franchise. Robert Pattinson will perform the
                  role of the Bruce Wayne / Batman.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                  The film is directed by Matt Reeves, who wrote the screenplay
                  with Mattson Tomlin. The Dark Knight dons a new suit in this
                  reboot of the DC superhero comic book movie franchise. Rumored
                  to be called "The Batman", this project is set to follow on
                  the heels of the team-up film Batman v Superman and the
                  formation of the Justice League.

                <p class="text">
                  In August 2013, Ben Affleck was cast as Bruce Wayne / Batman
                  in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), with plans to play the
                  role in at least three films. He made his debut in Batman v
                  Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), and later appeared in
                  Suicide Squad (2016) and Justice League (2017). In October
                  2014, Warner Bros. revealed plans for a standalone Batman film
                  starring Affleck, and by July 2015, he was in negotiations to
                  direct and co-write the screenplay with Geoff Johns. According
                  to Deadline Hollywood, Affleck and Johns were expected to turn
                  in a draft by October 2015, and that production would begin
                  after Affleck finished work on Live by Night. The plot was to
                  be set after the events of Batman v Superman and Justice
                  League; Affleck stated that the film would feature a "mostly
                  original" story that used elements of comic books for
                  inspiration, like what director Zack Snyder did with Batman v
                  Superman. According to Robert Richardson, who was attached as
                  cinematographer early in development, Affleck's script was set
                  in Arkham Asylum and dealt with insanity.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                  Affleck and Johns finished the first draft in March 2016, with
                  Johns implying that the film would explore the death of Robin
                  which was hinted at in Batman v Superman. At CinemaCon in
                  April, Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara confirmed the film was
                  moving forward, with Affleck directing. In the following
                  months, Jeremy Irons and Joe Manganiello were confirmed to
                  appear—with Manganiello playing Deathstroke—and Jared Leto
                  expressed interest in reprising his role as the Joker from
                  Suicide Squad. Affleck revealed the title of the film was The
                  Batman in October, and in December he said filming was on
                  track to begin in mid-2017 for a release date in 2018. That
                  month, a planned Justice League sequel was delayed to
                  accommodate The Batman. However, in January 2017, Affleck said
                  the film had no script and that he may end up not directing
                  it. While Affleck reaffirmed his commitment to direct in an
                  appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, by the end of the month he
                  decided to step down; nonetheless, he stated he would still
                  star and produce. By this point, Chris Terrio had turned in a
                  rewrite of the script.

                  In August 2018, Reeves appeared on a Television Critics
                  Association panel and revealed many details about the film. He
                  confirmed that The Batman would be an original, noir-driven
                  story and not an origin story. He also revealed that the
                  script was nearing completion and that the film's connections
                  to the DCEU would be minimal but present. Reeves said that he
                  was "working on getting our draft in the next couple of weeks
                  and things are progressing," hoping to begin production in
                  early-to-mid 2019. Reeves submitted his first draft to Warner
                  Bros. the following month. Affleck's involvement was in doubt;
                  Kim Masters of The Hollywood Reporter reported in July 2017
                  that Warner Bros. was looking to replace him. This was
                  strengthened by further reports indicating that Reeves wanted
                  a younger actor to play Batman. In August 2018, Affleck went
                  to rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, casting further doubt
                  that he would be reprising his role. In January 2019, Warner
                  Bros. set a June , 2021 release date for The Batman, and
                  Affleck confirmed that he was departing. Affleck revealed in
                  2020 that he stepped down due to a combination of factors,
                  including his divorce from Jennifer Garner, the tumultuous
                  production of Justice League, his personal lack of enjoyment
                  in the role, and his alcohol problems. "I showed [my friend]
                  the Batman script," he recalled. "They said, 'I think the
                  script is good. I also think you'll drink yourself to death if
                  you go through what you just went through again."
